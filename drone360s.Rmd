Mounting a 360 Camera on Your Drone - not recommended

Hangar - makes it easy, stitching done online. Requires a DJI drone and a iOS device

```{r hangarpano, echo=FALSE, screenshot.opts = list(delay = 5), cache = TRUE}
knitr::include_url("https://viewer.hangar.com/360?productId=bYLR7Lrm")
```

Litchi - Panorama mode, have to stitch on your own

Mavic 2 - has a built-in 360 mode
