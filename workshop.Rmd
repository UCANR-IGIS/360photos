# Workshop Materials

## Phone / Tablet Apps

During the workshop, we'll be looking at how people are using 360 photos and tours for education, business, and even research. We'll also collect some of our own 360 photos and discuss how we might use them.

In preparation, please install the following apps on your phone or tablet. If your device doesn't have enough memory or you encounter technical problems, don't worry. We'll deal with it at the workshop.
