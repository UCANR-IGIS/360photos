# Workshop Materials

During the workshop, we will:

1. Explore examples how other organizations are using 360 photos for education, business, and research.
1. Collect some of our own 360 photos using i) apps that allow you to take a 360 panorama or photosphere using just your phone's camera, and ii) a 360 camera (the Ricoh Theta SC).
1. Discuss how we might use 360 photos for environmental monitoring and/or education.

**Optional: Taking photos with the Theta SC**

The Theta app is used to control the Theta SC Camera. Therefore only one person per camera needs this app.
