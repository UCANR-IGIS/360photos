People and organizations are using 360 photos to share experiences, show what a place looks like in person, and convey all sorts of information about a what makes a place unique and special. Although the equipment and software behind this technology have gotten dramatically easier and cheapr to use, the field is still fairly young. There are a number of hardware options to consider, shooting techniques, software, and dissemiation choices. Ultimately, the choice of tools should match the needs of the project and the amount of time and resources available. This guide describes techniques for using consumer grade 360 photography hardware and software. We do not attempt to cover creating high quality 360 photos using high end DSLR cameras with special tripod heads and processing software. For that, see the many excellent tutorials online, YouTube videos, and online short courses available. This guide does also not cover 360 video, although many of the considerations will be the same.

Key Specs: Theta SC resolution: 14 MPx () See http://www.threesixtycameras.com/ricoh-theta-v-vs-ricoh-theta-s/ 2.1.2 Gear 360 / Gear 360 (2017) Gear 360 Specs: Resoultion: 30MP (7776 x 3888) Gear 360 still image resolution: 30MP (2x 15MP sensors) Gear 360 (2017) still image resolution: 15MP (2x 8.4MP sensors) See also: https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-gear-360-2017-vs-gear-360-2016 2.2 Phone &amp; Tablets Things to think about when selecting a phone or tablet to use with your 360 camera: Location enabled. Most 360 cameras don’t have GPS receivers in them. Instead, they rely on the location from the device that triggers it. Therefore if you want your photos to have location saved in the EXIF data, make sure your phone or tablet is equipped with a GPS receiever (not all tablets have this feature), and location services are turned on. Memory. Make sure your phone or tablet has enough storage space to hold the photos you collect. 2.3 Tripods / Monopods A tripod or monopod gets the camera off the ground and helps you stablize it. Because the 360 photo will include the area directly below the camera, you may wish to use a tripod with a smaller footprint. Some monopods and even selfie sticks have bases with little legs that can work quite well. Note however there’s a trade-off between using a tripod with a smaller base and its stability. Although 360 cameras are not terribly heavy, a gust of wind or uneven ground could topple it over. Also, soft ground such as grass or leaf liter can make it difficult for the legs to stay put. To improve stability, consider using a regular tripod but only extend the legs as far as needed for stability. Light stands can work well also. You can also anchor the legs with weights, sand bags, or stakes. 2.4 Painters Pole For a higher perspective that doesn’t require the use of a drone, you can mount your camera on top of a painters pole or even a broomstick with a threaded end. You’ll also need an adapter with a 1/4&quot; thread that can screw on top of the pole, such as ProPole from ClickSnap. 2.5 Helmet Mount A helmet mount is useful for recording photos using your camera’s automatic time lapse mode while walking. This is a common way of capture 360 photos for Street View. For instructions on building a helmet mount from a skateboard helmet, see the Appendix Building a Helmet Mount. 2.6 Accessories Tripod ball head "],

Typically these apps support viewing 360s in VR headsets like Google Cardboard. Google Cardboard. Android | iTunes The Google Cardboard app is required if you’re using a Google Cardboard style headset. Several sample 360 tours are provided. RoundMe. Android | iTunes RoundMe is one of the more popular online platforms for creating and hosting 360s tours. While you can you view RoundMe tours in a browser, the app provides additional features including searching. When using a VR headset, you can ‘click’ a hotspot by keeping it in the center of the frame for a couple of seconds. Kuula. Android | iTunes Kuula.com is another popular hosting service with its own app. 3.2 Apps to take 360 photos using just your phone Cardboard Camera. Android | iTunes Google Cardboard Camera makes it easy to take nice panoramas. Features include exposure lock, which minimizes vertical banding, and recording sound. You can share panoramas you take via the usual options. Google Camera. The Google Camera app is only available on Nexus and Pixel Android devices (phones and tablets manufactured by Google). Unofficial versions may be available for other phones. It includes four panorama modes (Horizontal, Vertical, Wide-angle and Fisheye) as well as the ability to take a full-360 photosphere. 360 Panorama. Android - not available | iTunes 360 Panorama from Occipital is a $2 app for iPhones and iPads. It guides you in taking taking a series of photos by slowly pointing the camera in all directions. For best quality, try to keep the lens in roughly the same position. When done, the app will stitch the images for you. See also the Google Street View app below, which also allows you to take 360 photos using just your phone. 3.3 Camera-Specific Apps Theta. Android | iTunes The Theta app for iOS and Android allows you to control the Theta V, Theta S, and Theta SC cameras using your phone or tablet. Different versions are available - be sure to get the right app for your specific camera. After connecting to the Theta via WiFi, you can control the camera’s settings including shooting mode, white balance, timer, etc. The app also lets you transfer stitched images from the camera to the device, and share them on the Theta360.com platform. See also Theta SC Step-by-Step. Gear 360. Android | iTunes The Gear 360 app controls the Gear 360 and Gear 360 (2017) cameras (yes, those are different). An important caveat if you’re an Android user - the app only works if on a high end Samsung phongs and tablets. iPad userthes are also out of luck - it only works on iPhones. If you have a compatible device, the app allows you to control the camera via WiFi, transfer 360 content to your phone, and share on social media. With a Gear 360 (2017) camera, you can also broadcast live video. 3.4 Multi-Camera Apps Google Street View. Android | iTunes The Google Street View app is available on both Android and iOS. It has four main functions: Allow people to view the thousands of “Streetview” photospheres on Google Maps. Makes it easy to take photospheres, either with or without an external 360 camera Provides tools to blur faces, license plates, and any other sensitive parts of the image Makes it easy to upload images to the cloud. To take 360 photos, GSV offers a number of options and features: It can control several external 360 cameras, including the Samsung Gear 360, Ricoh Theta S, and others. The external camera can be triggered manually or set on timer in case you want to take pictures as you walk or bike. If you don’t have an external 360 camera, you can still take 360 photos with GSV. The app will prompt you to point to a series of red dots. For additional info, see the Appendix on Google Street View Step-by-Step. 3.5 Drone 360 Apps Hangar 360 for DJI Drones. Android - not supported | iTunes The Hangar 360 app will fly your drone to 300 feet, take 23 still images in different directions and angles, and then land automatically. There’s also an option to manually fly it to a location of your choosing, and then activate the picture-taking. At any point, you can take over control (which is probably a good idea for landing). After it lands, don’t turn off the drone. Wait for the images to transfer from the drone to your device. After the images have been copied to your device, you can choose to upload them to Hangar’s cloud processing services. They will stitch the images together, and send you a URL. The results are spectacular. The one potential caveat about Hangar is that if you use their cloud processing services, your 360 will be publicly viewable. DronePan. Android - not supported | iTunes DronePan is an iOS app that will take over control of DJI drone and take a series of pictures in different directions and pitch angles suitable for stitching into a 360 panorama. To use DronePan, you manually fly your drone to where you want it to take the panorama, then let DronePan take over. The app does not stitch the images together, for that you’ll need to use other software or a cloud service. DronePan is only available for iPhones and iPads running iOS 10.2 or later, and only works with DJI drones. DronePan is open source and free. Version 2.0 came out in summer 2018. Litchi for DJI Drones. Android - not supported | iTunes Litchi is a full-featured mission planning and flight management app. Among the many flight modes is a Panorama mode that will take a series of images at different angles and pitches. Stitching is not supported. Litchi costs $23. "],
["shooting_tips.html", "4 Shooting Tips 4.1 Positioning the Camera 4.2 Lighting 4.3 Collecting Ancillary Data 4.4 Field Kit", " 4 Shooting Tips 4.1 Positioning the Camera Make sure the camera is as vertical as possible. This will produce the image quality and eliminate or reduce the need to ‘level’ the image in your processing software. Keeping the camera vertical is most challenging when mounted on a selfie stick or helmet. In general, put the objets of interest in the front of the lens, not to the side. Image quality is best near the front of the lens. You get the best results when there are no objects very close (e.g., 10 ft) to the camera lens. If something is close to the camera, point one of the lenses toward it, not on the side. The camera will have an easier time stitching the two hemispheric photos together when the objects on the edges are farther away. It can be challenging for the photographer not to appear in a 360 photo. If the camera is triggered wirelessly, you may be able to duck behind a tree or other object. Note however if there are objects between the phone and the camera, the camera may not get the signal. If this becomes a problem, you may be able to set the camera to trigger on a timer, to give you enough time to get out of sight after pressing the shutter. If there are no objects to hide behind, consider where you’ll be the least distraction for the viewer. It’s also possible to ‘Photoshop’ yourself out of a 360, although this requires special software. If you plan to digitally remove yourself from the image, make yourself as small as possible and stand in front of a surface that will be easy to clone. Remember also that the GPS coordinates saved in the image file are usually taken from the mobile device that’s controlling the 360 camera. Hence the farther you stand away from the camera, the less accurate the location will be. Depending on the application, this could be an issue. 4.2 Lighting You’ll get the nicest image when all parts of the scene are lit evenly. Overcast days can be good days for photography. On clear days, you may want to avoid the early and late afternoon hours when the sun is low in the sky. If the scene is unevenly lit, for example some objects are in shadow, try using HDR mode if your camera supports it. Note however HDR mode doesn’t work as well when objects in the photo are in motion which can result in blur. 4.3 Collecting Ancillary Data Depending on the project, you may need to record other information about the area. For example you might take notes about objects in the photo to add later as textboxes or accompanying text, close-up photos with a DSLR camera, or even video clips. After the shoot, you’ll need to match up your 360 photos with other data collected. To help you sync your 360 images with the other data, it helps to make sure all the devices are set to the same time. You can also keep a log of each of the 360 locations (i.e., nodes), and note the location name or number when you record other observations. If taking a series of accompanying photos or video, consider taking a picture of a notepad with the location name, or even just your hand, so when you copy the files to your competer you’ll be able to easily see when you switched from one location to the next. 4.4 Field Kit lens cloth power pack (for recharging tablet and/or camera) weights or sand bags or other for tripod legs "],

["thetasc.html", "A Theta SC Step-by-Step A.1 Camera Diagram A.2 Taking and Viewing Photos A.3 Settings", " A Theta SC Step-by-Step The Ricoh Theta SC is a consumer grade 360 camera. The Theta SC is a pared down version of the Theta S, the main differences being the Theta SC cannot live-stream 360 footage, continuous video recording time is limited to 5 minutes, and the compass direction is not recorded. In all other respects, the models are the same. The Theta SC has 8Gb of internal memory, which is not expandable. You should be able to take about 260 photos on one battery charge. The Theta SC has a micro-USB port which is used both for charging as well as transferring images to a computer. The camera also gives a WiFi signal, which you can use to connect to the camera with a app. The apps you’ll probably use with the Theta SC are the Theta or the Google Street View apps. A.1 Camera Diagram A.2 Taking and Viewing Photos Preparation. Before going to the field, make sure your Theta SC is charged up. If you’ll be taking a lot of photos, consider deleting any existing photos in the camera (connect it to a computer with the USB cable). 2. Turn on the camera by pressing the button on the side. 3. Turn on the WiFi on the camera, if it isn’t on already. The little WiFi light on the front of the camera should appear white. 4. Connect to the Theta’s WiFi on your phone or tablet. Look for a WiFi signal that starts with THETA. If someone hasn’t changed the default password, it will be the numbers in the SSID. This can also be read on the label on the bottom of the camera. It’s possible to change the WiFi and password using the Theta app. Being connected to the camera’s WiFi doesn’t mean you have internet access. In fact you probably won’t have internet unless you have another internet connection, for example through your cellular provider. The camera’s WiFi merely allows your phone or tablet to control the camera. 5. Start the Theta app on your phone or tablet. The first screen you’ll see will display any 360 photos you have saved on your phone. The next button will display any photos saved on the camera you’re connected to. If you want to copy them to your phone or tablet, select the images and click the download icon. Note you can also copy images from the camera directly to a computer using a USB cable. 6. Go to ‘shooting mode’ by clicking the Theta icon that looks like an eyeball. You’re now ready to start taking photos by clicking the shutter button. Remember: when you take pictures using the Theta app, the photos are saved on the camera. They are only copied to your phone when you copy them over using the ‘Cam Images’ screen. A.3 Settings Additional settings you can explore: Timer. To give yourself a few seconds to hide. Click on the Settings icon and change the Shooting method to ‘self-timer’. HDR mode.

["helmet-mount.html", "C Building a Helmet Mount C.1 Why a Helmet Mount C.2 Parts C.3 Assembly", " C Building a Helmet Mount C.1 Why a Helmet Mount Mounting a 360 camera on a helmet allows you to take a series of 360 images while walking or riding a bike, thereby covering a long distance relatively quickly. Typically, you would set the camera to trigger automatically on a time lapse. Helmet mounts are commonly used when the goal is a series of 360 photos to be contributed to Google Street View. (Note however the Google Street View app recommends walking, not riding a bike, so images are close enough to automatically link to the next.) Although there are commercial helmet mounts for GoPro and other action cameras, these may or may not work with a 360 camera that uses a standard tripod screw. Fortunately it isn’t very difficult to build a mount for a 360 camera, because a tripod screw is simply a standard 1/4&quot; machine screw. Although you can attach a mount for a camera on any kind of head gear, sport helmets have the advantage of being sturdy which is important as you don’t want your camera to fall off. They are also rigid, which helps keep the camera vertical. Helmets also have padding and straps which help them stay in position and be relatively comfortable. C.2 Parts C.2.1 A Helmet Most helmets will work provided you can mount a 1/4&quot; machine screw on top. A bicycle helment with ventilation slots might work if you can thread the screw through a short brace and then secure it with cable ties. If you’re getting a helmet specifically for the purpose of mounting a camera, look for one that is dark in color which won’t affect the camera’s white balance, and won’t be a distraction in the photos. Another good feature to look for is hole in the top. Many skakeboard helmets have ventilation holes on top, so you don’t have to do any drilling, and can be purchased for around $20. Skateboard helmets often have a conveniently located hole at the top. C.2.2 Hardware Pieces The rest of the hardware pieces can be bought at a standard hardware store for less than $2. A. 1/4 x 4&quot; flat head machine screw. The head goes inside the helmet. A flat head provides the lowest profile so the end isn’t rubbing against your scalp. B. 3/8&quot; x 1&quot; washer. This goes inside the helmet also. The larger diameter of the inner circle reduces the portion of the machine screw head that juts out. C. 5/16&quot; x 1 1/4&quot; washer. The bigger washer goes on the outside of the helmet, and is secured with a standard 1/4&quot; nut (D). You can paint the washer black to make it less noticable in the photos. D. 1/4&quot; nut (x2). E. 1/4&quot; wing nut. A wing nut allows you to tighten and untighter the screw that keeps the camera by hand. Never over-tighten anything that screws onto a tripod, you risk damaging it or not being able to get it off! F. 5/16&quot; x 1/2“ washer. Prevent scratching the bottom of the camera. C.3 Assembly The assembled mount looks like: Ready for action! "],
