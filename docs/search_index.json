People and organizations are using 360 photos to share experiences, show what a place looks like in person, and convey all sorts of information about a what makes a place unique and special. Although the equipment and software behind this technology have gotten dramatically easier and cheapr to use, the field is still fairly young. There are a number of hardware options to consider, shooting techniques, software, and dissemiation choices. Ultimately, the choice of tools should match the needs of the project and the amount of time and resources available. This guide describes techniques for using consumer grade 360 photography hardware and software. We do not attempt to cover creating high quality 360 photos using high end DSLR cameras with special tripod heads and processing software. For that, see the many excellent tutorials online, YouTube videos, and online short courses available. This guide does also not cover 360 video, although many of the considerations will be the same. Feedback Wanted! This guide is a work in progress, and feedback is much appreciated. All contributors will be acknowledged! If you see a typo or have an edit to a section, please email the author .

Most 360 cameras dont have GPS receivers in them. Instead, they rely on the location from the device that triggers it. Therefore if you want your photos to have location saved in the EXIF data, make sure your phone or tablet is equipped with a GPS receiever (not all tablets have this feature), and location services are turned on. Memory. Make sure your phone or tablet has enough storage space to hold the photos you collect. 2.3 Tripods / Monopods A tripod or monopod gets the camera off the ground and helps you stablize it. Because the 360 photo will include the area directly below the camera, you may wish to use a tripod with a smaller footprint. Some monopods and even selfie sticks have bases with little legs that can work quite well. Note however theres a trade-off between using a tripod with a smaller base and its stability. Although 360 cameras are not terribly heavy, a gust of wind or uneven ground could topple it over. Also, soft ground such as grass or leaf liter can make it difficult for the legs to stay put. Light stand with a tablet holder mount To improve stability, consider using a regular tripod but only extend the legs as far as needed for stability. Light stands can work well also. You can also anchor the legs with weights, sand bags, or stakes. Sandbags, weights, or stakes can help anchor the legs of a monopod on soft ground 2.4 Painters Pole For a higher perspective that doesnt require the use of a drone, you can mount your camera on top of a painters pole or even a broomstick with a threaded end. Youll also need an adapter with a 1/4\" thread that can screw on top of the pole, such as ProPole from ClickSnap. 2.5 Helmet Mount A helmet mount is useful for recording photos using your cameras automatic time lapse mode while walking. This is a common way of capturing 360 photos for a trail or transect that you want to share via Google Street View. When wearing a helmet mount, remember to keep your head up and look forward so the camera stays vertical For instructions on building a helmet mount from a skateboard helmet, see the Appendix Building a Helmet Mount. 2.6 Accessories Tripod ball head.

Typically these apps support viewing 360s in VR headsets like Google Cardboard. Google Cardboard. Android | iTunes The Google Cardboard app is required if youre using a Google Cardboard style headset. Several sample 360 tours are provided. RoundMe. Android | iTunes RoundMe is one of the more popular online platforms for creating and hosting 360s tours. While you can you view RoundMe tours in a browser, the app provides additional features including searching. When using a VR headset, you can click a hotspot by keeping it in the center of the frame for a couple of seconds. Kuula. Android | iTunes Kuula.com is another popular hosting service with its own app. 3.2 Smartphone camera apps Google Camera. The Google Camera app is pre-installed on Nexus and Pixel Android devices (phones and tablets manufactured by Google). Unofficial versions may be available for other phones. It includes four panorama modes (Horizontal, Vertical, Wide-angle and Fisheye) as well as the ability to take a full-360 photosphere. 360 Panorama. Android - not available | iTunes 360 Panorama from Occipital is a $2 app for iPhones and iPads. It guides you in taking taking a series of photos by slowly pointing the camera in all directions. For best quality, try to keep the lens in roughly the same position. When done, the app will stitch the images for you. Cardboard Camera. Android | iTunes No longer available Google Cardboard Camera makes it easy to take nice panoramas. Features include exposure lock, which minimizes vertical banding, and recording sound. You can share panoramas you take via the usual options. See also the Google Street View app below, which also allows you to take 360 photos using just your phone. 3.3 360 Camera Manufacturer Apps When you buy a 360 camera, you almost always have to download and install an app from the manufacturer to configure your camera. These apps also allow you to take pictures via WiFi or Bluetooth, and may have additional features such as sharing your 360 photos online, editing them, time lapse photography, video editing, etc. Theta. Android | iTunes The Theta app for iOS and Android allows you to control the Theta V, Theta S, and Theta SC cameras using your phone or tablet. Different versions are available - be sure to get the right app for your specific camera. After connecting to the Theta via WiFi, you can control the cameras settings including shooting mode, white balance, timer, etc. The app also lets you transfer stitched images from the camera to the device, and share them on the Theta360.com platform. See also Theta SC Step-by-Step. Gear 360. Android | iTunes The Gear 360 app controls the Gear 360 and Gear 360 (2017) cameras (yes, those are different). An important caveat if youre an Android user - the app only works if on a high end Samsung phongs and tablets. iPad userthes are also out of luck - it only works on iPhones. If you have a compatible device, the app allows you to control the camera via WiFi, transfer 360 content to your phone, and share on social media. With a Gear 360 (2017) camera, you can also broadcast live video. 3.4 Multi-Camera Apps Google Street View. Android | iTunes The Google Street View app is available on both Android and iOS. It has four main functions: Allow people to view the thousands of Streetview photospheres on Google Maps. Makes it easy to take photospheres, either with or without an external 360 camera Provides tools to blur faces, license plates, and any other sensitive parts of the image Makes it easy to upload images to the cloud. To take 360 photos, GSV offers a number of options and features: It can control several external 360 cameras, including the Samsung Gear 360, Ricoh Theta S, and others. The external camera can be triggered manually or set on timer in case you want to take pictures as you walk or bike. If you dont have an external 360 camera, you can still take 360 photos with GSV. The app will prompt you to point to a series of red dots. For additional info, see the Appendix on Google Street View Step-by-Step. 3.5 Drone 360 Apps See Drone 360 Apps in Chapter 7. "],["shooting_tips.html", "4 Shooting Tips 4.1 Positioning the Camera 4.2 Lighting 4.3 Collecting Ancillary Data 4.4 Field Kit", " 4 Shooting Tips 4.1 Positioning the Camera Make sure the camera is as vertical as possible. This will produce the image quality and eliminate or reduce the need to level the image in your processing software. Keeping the camera vertical is most challenging when mounted on a selfie stick or helmet. In general, put the objects of interest in the front of the lens, not to the side. Image quality is best near the front of the lens. You get the best results when you position the camera to reduce or eliminate objects close to the lens (e.g., 10 ft). If there is no avoiding objects close to the camera, put those objects in front of a lens toward it, not on the side where the two images have to be stitched together. Consider where you will stand when you take the photo. It can be challenging for the photographer not to appear in a 360 photo. If the camera is triggered wirelessly, you may be able to duck behind a tree or other object. Note however if there are objects between the phone and the camera, the camera may not get the signal to take a picture (e.g., if youre hiding behind a big tree). If this becomes a problem, you may be able to set the camera to trigger on a timer, to give you enough time to get out of sight after pressing the shutter. Putting your camera on timer can give you time to duck behind an object If there are no objects to hide behind, consider where youll be the least distraction for the viewer. Its also possible to Photoshop yourself out of a 360, although this requires special software. If you plan to digitally remove yourself from the image, make yourself as small as possible and stand in front of a surface that will be easy to clone. Remember also that the GPS coordinates saved in the image file are usually taken from the mobile device thats controlling the 360 camera. Hence the farther you stand away from the camera when you press the shutter, the less accurate the location will be. Depending on the application, this could be an issue. 4.2 Lighting Youll get the nicest image when all parts of the scene are lit evenly. Overcast days can be good days for photography. On clear days, you may want to avoid the early and late afternoon hours when the sun is low in the sky. If the scene is unevenly lit, for example some objects are in shadow, consider using HDR mode if your camera supports it. Note however that HDR mode doesnt work as well when objects in the photo are in motion which can result in blur. 4.3 Collecting Ancillary Data Depending on the project, you may need to record other information about the area. For example you might take notes about objects in the photo to add later as textboxes or accompanying text, close-up photos with a DSLR camera, or even video clips. After the shoot, youll need to match up your 360 photos with other data collected on your computer. If youre only taking or two photos, that wont be difficult. But if youre taking several, there are some steps you can take to help you put them together. To help you sync your 360 images with the other data, it helps to make sure all the devices are set to the same time. You can also keep a log of each of the 360 locations (i.e., nodes), and note the location name or number when you record other observations. If taking addtional photos (with a different camera) or video to attach to your 360, consider taking a picture of a notepad with the location name before you start (the same way movies scenes start with a picture of a slate). Or you simply take a picture of your hand, so when you view the files on your computer youll be able to easily see when a new location is coming. 4.4 Field Kit  tripod or monopod  lens cloth  extra battery for the camera (if possible)  power pack (for recharging tablet and/or camera)  weights or sand bags or other for tripod legs "],["editing.html", "5 Editing 360 Photos 5.1 Editing Tasks 5.2 Software", " 5 Editing 360 Photos 5.1 Editing Tasks 5.1.1 Stitching connecting adjacent images projecting into 360 format filling in the sky / nadir image corrections lens distortion vignetting color enhancements contrast and brightness color transformations 5.1.2 Editing a Stitched 360 Image adding a nadir patch leveling (re)injecting 360 Metadata 5.2 Software 5.2.1 Stitching Commercial PTGui AutoPano Panorama Factory Free &amp; Open Source Hugin Microsoft Image Composite Editor 5.2.2 Viewers Panini see also (http://wiki.panotools.org/Panorama_Viewers){target=\"_blank\"} 5.2.3 Tour Builders 360 tour builders create clickable links between 360 photos, as well as labels, clickable hotspots, popup windows, sounds and video, etc. There are both online and desktop tour builds.

Android | iTunes DJI GO 4 (Phantom 4, Mavic Pro, Phantom 4 Pro, or Inspire 2) and DJI Fly (Mavic Air 2, Mini 2, and Mavic Mini) cover the bulk of DJIs consumer drones. If you have one of these drones, you need one of these apps to set important configuration settings such as the return-to-home altitude. As a nice perk, they also both feature a panorama camera mode. To take a 360 photo with one of these apps, you manually fly to your photo location, make sure the camera is in panorama mode, then trigger the camera. The app will then take control of the drone and capture a sequence of photos (up to 34 for a full 360 panorama). The app will even stitch the photos for you, either immediately or after the flight. These apps actually have 4 panorama modes - sphere (full 360), 180 (very wide), horizontal (less wide), and vertical. For details, see the app documentation or tutorials like this one for DJI GO 4 on YouTube. The panorama stitched in the app is relatively low resolution (4096 x 2048), so while its great as a preview and may be fine for social media, it may not be the ultimate product. Fortunately One of the nice features of these apps is that the photos the drone takes remain on the memory card. This gives you the option of stitching them with your own software if you want a higher resolution or want to manually correct some of the edges. DronePan. Android - not supported | iTunes DronePan is an iOS app that will take over control of DJI drone and take a series of pictures in different directions and pitch angles suitable for stitching into a 360 panorama. To use DronePan, you manually fly your drone to where you want it to take the panorama, then let DronePan take over. The app does not stitch the images together, for that youll need to use other software or a cloud service. DronePan is only available for iPhones and iPads running iOS 10.2 or later, and only works with DJI drones. DronePan is open source and free. Version 2.0 came out in summer 2018. Litchi for DJI Drones. Android | iTunes Litchi is a full-featured mission planning and flight management app. Among the many flight modes is a Panorama mode that will take a series of images at different angles and pitches. Stitching is not supported. Litchi costs $23-$25. For more info on Litchi, see the Litchi Appendix. Hangar 360 for DJI Drones No longer available The Hangar 360 app will fly your drone to 300 feet, take 23 still images in different directions and angles, and then land automatically. Theres also an option to manually fly it to a location of your choosing, and then activate the picture-taking. At any point, you can take over control (which is probably a good idea for landing). After it lands, dont turn off the drone. Wait for the images to transfer from the drone to your device. After the images have been copied to your device, you can choose to upload them to Hangars cloud processing services. They will stitch the images together, and send you a URL. The results are spectacular. The one potential caveat about Hangar is that if you use their cloud processing services, your 360 will be publicly viewable. Hangar used to support cloud based processing as part of their iOS app. Alas the app no longer works. 7.5 Stitching In-app stitching - ok for previews, mobile devices, and social media, but resolution is pretty low. Use stitching software to get best results. 7.6 Sharing 360s To get the best resolution, you need a platform that supports high resolutions and multiresolution.

The Theta SC is a pared down version of the Theta S, the main differences being the Theta SC cannot live-stream 360 footage, continuous video recording time is limited to 5 minutes, and the compass direction is not recorded. In all other respects, the models are the same. The Theta SC has 8Gb of internal memory, which is not expandable. You should be able to take about 260 photos on one battery charge. The Theta SC has a micro-USB port which is used both for charging as well as transferring images to a computer. The camera also gives a WiFi signal, which you can use to connect to the camera with a app. The apps youll probably use with the Theta SC are the Theta or the Google Street View apps. A.1 Camera Diagram A.2 Taking and Viewing Photos Preparation. Before going to the field, make sure your Theta SC is charged up. If youll be taking a lot of photos, consider deleting any existing photos in the camera (connect it to a computer with the USB cable). 2. Turn on the camera by pressing the button on the side. 3. Turn on the WiFi on the camera, if it isnt on already. The little WiFi light on the front of the camera should appear white. 4. Connect to the Thetas WiFi on your phone or tablet. Look for a WiFi signal that starts with THETA. If someone hasnt changed the default password, it will be the numbers in the SSID. This can also be read on the label on the bottom of the camera. Its possible to change the WiFi and password using the Theta app. Being connected to the cameras WiFi doesnt mean you have internet access. In fact you probably wont have internet unless you have another internet connection, for example through your cellular provider. The cameras WiFi merely allows your phone or tablet to control the camera. 5. Start the Theta app on your phone or tablet. The first screen youll see will display any 360 photos you have saved on your phone. The next button will display any photos saved on the camera youre connected to. If you want to copy them to your phone or tablet, select the images and click the download icon. Note you can also copy images from the camera directly to a computer using a USB cable. 6. Go to shooting mode by clicking the Theta icon that looks like an eyeball. Youre now ready to start taking photos by clicking the shutter button.

It is however possible to remove published photos you own from Google Maps. "],["helmet-mount.html", "Appendix C Building a Helmet Mount C.1 Why a Helmet Mount C.2 Parts C.3 Assembly", " Appendix C Building a Helmet Mount C.1 Why a Helmet Mount Mounting a 360 camera on a helmet allows you to take a series of 360 images while walking or riding a bike, thereby covering a long distance relatively quickly. Typically, you would set the camera to trigger automatically on a time lapse. Helmet mounts are commonly used when the goal is a series of 360 photos to be contributed to Google Street View. (Note however the Google Street View app recommends walking, not riding a bike, so images are close enough to automatically link to the next.) Although there are commercial helmet mounts for GoPro and other action cameras, these may or may not work with a 360 camera that uses a standard tripod screw. Fortunately it isnt very difficult to build a mount for a 360 camera, because a tripod screw is simply a standard 1/4\" machine screw. Although you can attach a mount for a camera on any kind of head gear, sport helmets have the advantage of being sturdy which is important as you dont want your camera to fall off. They are also rigid, which helps keep the camera vertical. Helmets also have padding and straps which help them stay in position and be relatively comfortable. C.2 Parts C.2.1 A Helmet Most helmets will work provided you can mount a 1/4\" machine screw on top. A bicycle helment with ventilation slots might work if you can thread the screw through a short brace and then secure it with cable ties. If youre getting a helmet specifically for the purpose of mounting a camera, look for one that is dark in color which wont affect the cameras white balance, and wont be a distraction in the photos. Another good feature to look for is hole in the top. Many skakeboard helmets have ventilation holes on top, so you dont have to do any drilling, and can be purchased for around $20. Skateboard helmets often have a conveniently located hole at the top. C.2.2 Hardware Pieces The rest of the hardware pieces can be bought at a standard hardware store for less than $2. A. 1/4 x 4\" flat head machine screw. The head goes inside the helmet. A flat head provides the lowest profile so the end isnt rubbing against your scalp. B. 3/8\" x 1\" washer. This goes inside the helmet also. The larger diameter of the inner circle reduces the portion of the machine screw head that juts out. C. 5/16\" x 1 1/4\" washer. The bigger washer goes on the outside of the helmet, and is secured with a standard 1/4\" nut (D). You can paint the washer black to make it less noticable in the photos. D. 1/4\" nut (x2). E. 1/4\" wing nut. A wing nut allows you to tighten and untighter the screw that keeps the camera by hand. Never over-tighten anything that screws onto a tripod, you risk damaging it or not being able to get it off! F. 5/16\" x 1/2\" washer. Prevent scratching the bottom of the camera.

"],["litchi.html", "Appendix D Litchi D.1 Pros and Cons D.2 Litchi Tips and Tricks", " Appendix D Litchi Litchi is one of the Drone 360 Apps you can use to take 360 photos with your drone. When triggered, the app will take control of the drone and take a series of still photos that can be stitched together to create a 360 panorama. In addition, the iOS version of the app can stitch the images into a 360 after the flight. D.1 Pros and Cons Features that people like about Litchi include: the Litchi mobile app is available for both iOS and Android. Litchi is designed for videographers who want to do complex video sequences that would be challenging to capture manually. Litchi supports many flight modes and waypoint actions including 360 panoramas. The Auto Pano button on the app will take control the drone during a flight to take a series of photos with enough overlap to stitch well. The default settings work well, but you can adjust the settings to take more or fewer images. Missions can also be designed on the app or before you go to the field on the Litchi website (called Mission Hub). Missions created using the website will be synced to the mobile app, after which you can use the app to fly the mission. (Note however that as of early 2021 the web-based mission planner still can not take enough photos at a waypoint for a full 360 panorama, only a single wrap-around panorama). Waypoint missions can be saved and repeated for monitoring programs. They also make it easy to share your mission with other users. The Litchi app for iOS can stitch 360 images after the drone lands, so you can check the quality while youre still in the field. The photos Litchi takes are saved on the memory card on the drone, so you can download them after the flight and stitch them with your own software. Limitations of Litchi include: It only works with a handful of DJI drones (including the DJI Mavic, Phantom, Inspire, and Spark) The iOS and Android app costs $25 each. If you want to use it on both Android and iOS devices, you have to buy both versions of the app. The number of features and options steepens the learning curve and takes a while to get used to. In-app stitching is only supported on the iOS Mobile App (note this feature is expected to be added to Android app in early 2021). Although you can add a series of actions to a waypoint mission to take photos at different angles, you can only do this at one pitch so it wont be a full 360 panorama. To take enough images for a full 360 panorama, you have to end the current mission (or fly manually to the desired location), and manually click the Auto Pano button on the app. Litchi does not support photogrammetry (mapping) missions. D.2 Litchi Tips and Tricks If youre new to Litchi, check out the getting started videos. Its not a simple app to use. Practice creating a simple waypoint mission using the app before you start planning missions via the Mission Hub website. Some people report conflicts if DJI GO and Litchi are running simultaneously. If you experience this, after youve done your pre-flight checks with DJI GO (i.e., verify the RTH altitude, check camera settings, etc), force close the DJI GO app and start Litchi. As with any app that flies your drone, learn how to take over control during a flight, and practice to make sure that works. You dont want to be fumbling around to take control as your drone is flying off into the sunset. Using the toggle switches on your remote controller is generally a more sure-fire way of taking manual control than buttons on an app. To test out Litchis panorama functions, start by flying manually to a location where youd like to take a 360 photo, then press the Auto Pano button on the app. This button is visible when youre on the Pano screen (more info). For best results, take panorama photos when the sun is high in the sky. If the sun is low enough to be in some of the photos, it will be more difficult for the stitching program to match the exposure with other images. Try taking panoramas from a few different altitudes (e.g., 50ft, 150ft, 300ft) to find a good balance between how far you can see into the distance and the amount of detail in the images. If the stitching doesnt turn out well, try to trouble shoot. Consider increasing the number of images taken (by increasing the amount of overlap), make sure youre flying with enough light. You may also stitch the images in a program that allows you to edit the tie points (e.g., Hugin). To create a mission that takes a 7-shot panorama (see caveat below) in Mission Hub, select the waypoint where you want the photo taken and click the Panorama Preset button. This will add the necessary actions to take 7 photos. Note: the 7-shot panorama you can program into a flight in Mission Hub is not the same as clicking the Auto Pano button during a flight (which takes 23 images, including a nadir image). To get a full 360 image, do not use Mission Hub. You can however use Mission Hub to plan a waypoint mission, and when it reaches a waypoint switch to Pano mode on the app and use the Auto Pano button.
