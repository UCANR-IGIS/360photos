# Apps

Mobile apps are commonly used in 360 photography for several functions:

- viewing 360 photos on the phone either by itself or inserted in a VR headset
- taking a series of still images and stitching them into a panorama or photosphere
- controlling a 360 camera
- publishing 360 images in the cloud
- controlling a drone to take photos for a 360 panorama 

## 360 Viewer Apps

Many of the online platforms that specialize in creating and/or hosting 360 tours have their own apps for viewing 360 tours. Typically these apps support viewing 360s in VR headsets like [Google Cardboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cardboard){target="_blank"}.

## 360 Camera Manufacturer Apps

When you buy a 360 camera, you almost always have to download and install an app from the manufacturer to configure your camera. These apps also allow you to take pictures via WiFi or Bluetooth, and may  have additional features such as sharing your 360 photos online, editing them, time lapse photography, video editing, etc.

<p>The Theta app for iOS and Android allows you to control the Theta V, Theta S, and Theta SC cameras using your phone or tablet. Different versions are available - be sure to get the right app for your specific camera. After connecting to the Theta via WiFi, you can control the camera's settings including shooting mode, white balance, timer, etc. The app also lets you transfer stitched images from the camera to the device, and share them on the Theta360.com platform.

<p>The Gear 360 app controls the Gear 360 and Gear 360 (2017) cameras (yes, those are different). An important caveat if you're an Android user - the app only works if on a high end Samsung phongs and tablets. iPad userthes are also out of luck - it only works on iPhones. If you have a compatible device, the app allows you to control the camera via WiFi, transfer 360 content to your phone, and share on social media. With a Gear 360 (2017) camera, you can also broadcast live video.</p>

## Multi-Camera Apps

<tr style="background-color:transparent;" id="gsv">
<td class="appicon" style="border:none;">![](images/google-street-view_100x100.png)</td>
<td class="appdesc" style="border:none;">**Google Street View**. [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.street){target="_blank"} | [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-street-view/id904418768){target="_blank"}

The Google Street View app is available on both Android and iOS. It has four main functions:

1. Allow people to view the thousands of "Streetview" photospheres on Google Maps.
1. Makes it easy to take photospheres, either with or without an external 360 camera
1. Provides tools to blur faces, license plates, and any other sensitive parts of the image
1. Makes it easy to upload images to the cloud. 

To take 360 photos, GSV offers a number of options and features:

- It can control several external [360 cameras](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/6281877){target="_blank"}, including the Samsung Gear 360, Ricoh Theta S, and others. The external camera can be triggered manually or set on timer in case you want to take pictures as you walk or bike.

- If you don't have an external 360 camera, you can still take 360 photos with GSV. The app will prompt you to point to a series of red dots.

For additional info, see the Appendix on [Google Street View Step-by-Step](gsv.html).
